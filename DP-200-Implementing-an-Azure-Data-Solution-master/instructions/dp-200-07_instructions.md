## Lab overview

In this module, students will learn how Azure Data factory can be used to orchestrate the data movement from a wide range of data platform technologies. They will be able to explain the capabilities of the technology and be able to set up an end to end data pipeline that ingests data from SQL Database and load the data into Azure Synapse Analytics. The student will also demonstrate how to call a compute resource.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Setup Azure Data Factory
1. Ingest data using the Copy Activity
1. Use the Mapping Data Flow task to perform transformation
1. Perform transformations using a compute resource

## Scenario
  
You are assessing the tooling that can help with the extraction, load and transforming of data into the data warehouse, and have asked a Data Engineer within your team to show a proof of concept of Azure Data Factory to explore the transformation capabilities of the product. The proof of concept does not have to be related to AdventureWorks data, and you have given them freedom to pick a dataset of thier choice to showcase the capabilities.

In addition, the Data Scientists have asked to confirm if Azure Databricks can be called from Azure Data Factory. To that end, you will create a simple proof of concept Data Factory pipeline that calls Azure Databricks as a compute resource.

At the end of this lad, you will have:

1. Setup Azure Data Factory
1. Ingested data using the Copy Activity
1. Used the Mapping Data Flow task to perform transformation
1. Performed transformations using a compute resource

## Exercise 3: Transforming Data with Mapping Data Flow
  
Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Individual exercise

Now that you have moved the data into Azure Data Lake Store Gen2, you are ready to build a Mapping Data Flow which will transform your data at scale via a spark cluster and then load it into a Data Warehouse. 
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Preparing the environment

1. Adding a Data Source

1. Using Mapping Data Flow transformation

1. Writing to a Data Sink

1. Running the Pipeline

### Task 1: Preparing the environment

1. **Turn on Data Flow Debug** Turn the **Data Flow Debug** slider located at the top of the authoring module on. 

    > NOTE: Data Flow clusters take 5-7 minutes to warm up.

1. **Add a Data Flow activity** In the Activities pane, open the Move and Transform accordion and drag the **Data Flow** activity onto the pipeline canvas. In the blade that pops up, click **Create new Data Flow** and select **Mapping Data Flow** and then click **OK**. Click on the  **pipeline1** tab and drag the green box from your Copy activity to the Data Flow Activity to create an on success condition. You will see the following in the canvass:

    ![Adding a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T01-img01.png)

### Task 2: Adding a Data Source

1. **Add an ADLS source** Double click on the Mapping Data Flow object in the canvas. Click on the Add Source button in the Data Flow canvas. In the **Source dataset** dropdown, select your **ADLSG2** dataset used in your Copy activity

    ![Adding a Source to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T02-img01.png)


    * If your dataset is pointing at a folder with other files, you may need to create another dataset or utilize parameterization to make sure only the moviesDB.csv file is read
    * If you have not imported your schema in your ADLS, but have already ingested your data, go to the dataset's 'Schema' tab and click 'Import schema' so that your data flow knows the schema projection.

    Once your debug cluster is warmed up, verify your data is loaded correctly via the Data Preview tab. Once you click the refresh button, Mapping Data Flow will show calculate a snapshot of what your data looks like when it is at each transformation.
  
### Task 3: Using Mapping Data Flow transformation

1. **Add a Select transformation to rename and drop a column** In the preview of the data, you may have noticed that the "Rotton Tomatoes" column is misspelled. To correctly name it and drop the unused Rating column, you can add a [Select transformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-flow-select) by clicking on the + icon next to your ADLS source node and choosing Select under Schema modifier.
    
    ![Adding a Transformation to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img01.png)

    In the **Name** as field, change 'Rotton' to 'Rotten'. To drop the Rating column, hover over it and click on the trash can icon.

    ![Using the Select Transformation to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img02.png)

1. **Add a Filter Transformation to filter out unwanted years** Say you are only interested in movies made after 1951. You can add a [Filter transformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-flow-filter) to specify a filter condition by clicking on the **+ icon** next to your Select transformation and choosing **Filter** under Row Modifier. Click on the **expression box** to open up the [Expression builder](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-expression-builder) and enter in your filter condition. Using the syntax of the [Mapping Data Flow expression language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-flow-expression-functions), **toInteger(year) > 1950** will convert the string year value to an integer and filter rows if that value is above 1950.

    ![Using the Filter Transformation to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img03.png)

    You can use the expression builder's embedded Data preview pane to verify your condition is working properly

    ![Using the Expression Builder in the Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img04.png)


1. **Add a Derive Transformation to calculate primary genre** As you may have noticed, the genres column is a string delimited by a '|' character. If you only care about the *first* genre in each column, you can derive a new column named **PrimaryGenre** via the [Derived Column](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-flow-derived-column) transformation by clicking on the **+ icon** next to your Filter transformation and choosing Derived under Schema Modifier. Similar to the filter transformation, the derived column uses the Mapping Data Flow expression builder to specify the values of the new column.

    ![Using the Derived Transformation to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img05.png)

    In this scenario, you are trying to extract the first genre from the genres column which is formatted as 'genre1|genre2|...|genreN'. Use the **locate** function to get the first 1-based index of the '|' in the genres string. Using the **iif** function, if this index is greater than 1, the primary genre can be calculated via the **left** function which returns all characters in a string to the left of an index. Otherwise, the PrimaryGenre value is equal to the genres field. You can verify the output via the expression builder's Data preview pane.

   
1. **Rank movies via a Window Transformation** Say you are interested in how a movie ranks within its year for its specific genre. You can add a [Window transformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-flow-window) to define window-based aggregations by clicking on the **+ icon** next to your Derived Column transformation and clicking Window under Schema modifier. To accomplish this, specify what you are windowing over, what you are sorting by, what the range is, and how to calculate your new window columns. In this example, we will window over PrimaryGenre and year with an unbounded range, sort by Rotten Tomato descending, a calculate a new column called RatingsRank which is equal to the rank each movie has within its specific genre-year.

    ![Window Over](Linked_Image_Files/WindowOver.PNG "Window Over")

    ![Window Sort](Linked_Image_Files/WindowSort.PNG "Window Sort")

    ![Window Bound](Linked_Image_Files/WindowBound.PNG "Window Bound")

    ![Window Rank](Linked_Image_Files/WindowRank.PNG "Window Rank")

1. **Aggregate ratings with an Aggregate Transformation** Now that you have gathered and derived all your required data, we can add an [Aggregate transformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-flow-aggregate) to calculate metrics based on a desired group by clicking on the **+ icon** next to your Window transformation and clicking Aggregate under Schema modifier. As you did in the window transformation, lets group movies by PrimaryGenre and year

    ![Using the Aggregate Transformation to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img10.png)

    In the Aggregates tab, you can aggregations calculated over the specified group by columns. For every genre and year, lets get the average Rotten Tomatoes rating, the highest and lowest rated movie (utilizing the windowing function) and the number of movies that are in each group. Aggregation significantly reduces the amount of rows in your transformation stream and only propagates the group by and aggregate columns specified in the transformation.

    ![Configuring the Aggregate Transformation to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img11.png)

    * To see how the aggregate transformation changes your data, use the Data Preview tab
   

1. **Specify Upsert condition via an Alter Row Transformation** If you are writing to a tabular sink, you can specify insert, delete, update and upsert policies on rows using the [Alter Row transformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-flow-alter-row) by clicking on the + icon next to your Aggregate transformation and clicking Alter Row under Row modifier. Since you are always inserting and updating, you can specify that all rows will always be upserted.

    ![Using the Alter Row Transformation to a Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T03-img12.png)

    

### Task 4: Writing to a Data Sink

1. **Write to a Azure Synapse Analytics Sink** Now that you have finished all your transformation logic, you are ready to write to a Sink.
    1. Add a **Sink** by clicking on the **+ icon** next to your Upsert transformation and clicking Sink under Destination.
    1. In the Sink tab, create a new data warehouse dataset via the **+ New button**.
    1. Select **Azure Synapse Analytics** from the tile list.
    1. Select a new linked service and configure your Azure Synapse Analytics connection to connect to the DWDB database created in Module 5. Click **Create** when finished.
    ![Creating an Azure Synapse Analytics connection in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T04-img01.png)
    1. In the dataset configuration, select **Create new table** and enter in the schema of **Dbo** and the  table name of **Ratings**. Click **OK** once completed.
    ![Creating an Azure Synapse Analytics table in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T04-img02.png)
    1. Since an upsert condition was specified, you need to go to the Settings tab and select 'Allow upsert' based on key columns PrimaryGenre and year.
    ![Configuring Sink settings in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T04-img03.png)
At this point, You have finished building your 8 transformation Mapping Data Flow. It's time to run the pipeline and see the results!

![Completed Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T04-img04.png)

## Task 5: Running the Pipeline

1. Go to the pipeline1 tab in the canvas. Because Azure Synapse Analytics in Data Flow uses [PolyBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/polybase-guide?view=sql-server-2017), you must specify a blob or ADLS staging folder. In the Execute Data Flow activity's settings tab, open up the PolyBase accordion and select your ADLS linked service and specify a staging folder path.

    ![PolyBase configuration in Azure Data Factory](Linked_Image_Files/M07-E03-T05-img01.png)

1. Before you publish your pipeline, run another debug run to confirm it's working as expected. Looking at the Output tab, you can monitor the status of both activities as they are running.

1. Once both activities succeeded, you can click on the eyeglasses icon next to the Data Flow activity to get a more in depth look at the Data Flow run.

1. If you used the same logic described in this lab, your Data Flow should will written 737 rows to your SQL DW. You can go into [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017) to verify the pipeline worked correctly and see what got written.
